-osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution

This tutorial provides a detailed explanation of the entire process a ticket goes through within the open-source helpdesk ticketing system osTicket, from the moment it is submitted to when it is finally resolved. To start, I will demonstrate how a ticket is created by a user facing a real issue. Then, I will show how an agent accesses the ticketing system to begin the process of resolving the ticket.

Insert the following ticket information:

Note: When mobile online banking is down, it can lead to a major loss in revenue for the company.

Step 2. ) Assignment and Communication
Login to osTicket as an Agent: (User: jane.doe / jane.doe@gmail.com)

For the ticket to be handled properly, information regarding the severity level can be changed. Because the entire mobile banking is down and critical to business impact, we will change the priority of this ticket to EMERGENCY and the SLA to SEV-A.
